## Dependencies

You will need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Getting Started

First, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone <repo-url> m/ant<my-project-name>
$ cd <my-project-name>
```

Then install dependencies and check that it works

```bash
$ make server.install      # Install the pip dependencies on the docker container
$ make server.start        # Run the container containing your local python server
```

The available routes [here](http://127.0.0.1:3000/application/spec).

## Commands

You can display availables make commands using `make`.

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `make server.start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

| `make <script>`      | Description                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `help`               | Display availables make commands                                             |
| `server.install`     | Install the pip dependencies on the server's container.                      |
| `server.start`       | Run your local server in its own docker container.                           |
| `server.daemon`      | Run your local server in its own docker container as a daemon.               |
| `server.upgrade`     | Upgrade pip packages interactively.                                          |
| `database.connect`   | Connect to your docker database.                                             |
| `database.migrate`   | Generate a database migration file using alembic, based on your model files. |
| `database.upgrade`   | Run the migrations until your database is up to date.                        |
| `database.downgrade` | Downgrade your database by one migration.                                    |
| `test`               | Run unit tests with pytest in its own container.                             |
| `test.coverage`      | Run test coverage using pytest-cov.                                          |
| `test.lint`          | Run flake8 on the `src` and `test` directories.                              |
| `test.safety`        | Run safety to check if your vendors have security issues.                    |
| `format.black`       | Format python files using Black.                                             |
| `format.isort`       | Order python imports using isort.                                            |

## Database

The database is in [PostgreSql](https://www.postgresql.org/).

Locally, you can connect to your database using :

```bash
$ make database.connect
```

## Development

To develop locally, here are your two options:

```bash
$ make server.start           # Create the containers containing your python server in your terminal
$ make server.daemon          # Create the containers containing your python server as a daemon
```
You can check the logs in the `./server.log` file.

## Testing

You can run your tests in their own container with the command:

```bash
$ make test
```

## Lint

To lint your code using flake8, just run in your terminal:

```bash
$ make test.lint
```

## Swagger

The API description will be available [here](http://127.0.0.1:3000/application/spec).
The Swagger UI will be available [here](http://127.0.0.1:3000/apidocs/).
